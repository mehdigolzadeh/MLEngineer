# How to setup Sagemaker:

[getting started with sagemaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs.html)

# An Amazon SageMaker Domain consists of the following:

* An associated Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume
* A list of authorized users
* A variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) configurations

# AutoML

# All types of Sagemaker development environment
 * **Amazon SageMaker Studio:** The latest web-based experience for running ML workflows with a suite of IDEs. Studio supports the following applications.
      * Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic
      * Code Editor, based on Code-OSS, Visual Studio Code - Open Source
      * JupyterLab
      * Amazon SageMaker Canvas
      * RStudio
 * **Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic:** Lets you build, train, debug, deploy, and monitor your machine learning models.
 * **Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances:** Lets you prepare and process data, and train and deploy machine learning models from a compute instance running the Jupyter Notebook application.
 * **Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab:** Studio Lab is a free service that gives you access to AWS compute resources, in an environment based on open-source JupyterLab, without requiring an AWS account.
 * **Amazon SageMaker Canvas:** Gives you the ability to use machine learning to generate predictions without needing to code.
 * **Amazon SageMaker geospatial:** Gives you the ability to build, train, and deploy geospatial models.
 * **RStudio on Amazon SageMaker:** RStudio is an IDE for R, with a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.
 * **SageMaker HyperPod:** SageMaker HyperPod lets you provision resilient clusters for running machine learning (ML) workloads and developing state-of-the-art models such as large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and foundation models (FMs).
