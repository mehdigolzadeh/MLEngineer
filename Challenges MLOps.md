### Problems a model may face after deployment:
  * Concept drift
    - Change in the outputs of the data (Y)
  * Data drift
    - Change in the input data (X)
   
There are two types of change:
  * Gradual changes (Some new words maybe added to a language through time)
  * Sudden changes (A new phone has a new microphone and the input data is completely changed)
  Important task => Manage the changes to the data
  
### Software engineering issues
  * Realtime or batch process?
  * Cloud or edge/browser?
  * Computing resources
  * Latency/Throughput (QPS)
  * Logging
  * Security and privacy
